<h2>Who am I?</h2>
  <p class="bio-text">
    Hello! I'm Tulio, the creator of Talio Games. I've worked on numerous projects, but the only ones that are currently official and public are <a href="/teko" target="_blank">TEKO</a> (a Roguelike Deckbuilder with incremental elements and fantasy poker hands - basically a Balatrolike) and <a href="/aeftb" target="_blank">AEFTB</a> (Almohadin: Escape from the Basement - a colorful 2D competitive masocore platformer).
    <br><br>
    I started drawing and coming up with my own creations, characters, and stories when I was 6 years old (2006), and in 2012 I started creating my own video games using Game Maker - in my opinion, the easiest engine for beginners (I still use it!). My motto is to reinvent what already exists and give it a twist with my own unique style.
    My graphics are inspired by the typical browser flash games of the 2000s, and my stories are a collection of elements taken directly from comics I started creating at a very young age, which I eventually turned into a whole universe. I also love composing music, so my entire OST is handmade by me using FL Studio.
    <br><br>
    I would like to make a living from game development -not specifically for the money- but my goal is to have as much free time as possible to dedicate myself to what I love most. Right now, I work and spend a lot of time away from home, which prevents me from dedicating myself to my artistic expression. One of my dreams is to be able to create a game of every genre and have a small development team, or multiple studios dedicated to developing several games at once while I handle the design and general direction. I have many ideas and I know it's not impossible to execute them (in fact, I'm already working on it, having created 2 full games). 
    <br><br>
    My idea for the future is to be able to provide a product that people identify with, to create a solid community united by the same tastes, and for my followers to acquire a sense of belonging with my brand. To achieve this, I will always pay maximum attention to my unique style and characteristic elements that will always be consistent across all games. Briefly, I want to achieve a strong identity of my own. If you want to join me in this process, I recommend joining my <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Xk8RxfWBn6" target="_blank">Discord</a> server so you can participate with feedback, opinions, and new ideas; I am open to any message.
    <br><br>
    So far, all games are created solely by me from scratch. I am from Argentina (the economic context is terrible) and I don't have many resources, so please consider <a href="https://patreon.com/c/TalioGames" target="_blank">Donating</a> to give me a small financial contribution.
